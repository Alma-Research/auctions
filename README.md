# NFT Reserve Auctions

## Making the Reserve Auction Method

Reserve auctions have seen significant traction as a mechanism for selling NFTs, but they have typically been limited to proprietary marketplaces. MintFund's mission is to expand opportunity for artists hoping to break out into the crypto art scene. Part of that mission is providing open access to best-in-class tools that artists need to thrive. MindFund hosted a crowdfunding campaign with Mirror to fund the development of a permissionless auction method.
